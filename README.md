# Cayde-7
This is a Discord web scraper bot created by **[kibi](https://github.com/jaykibi)** initially to grab data on lost sector rewards for Destiny 2 from Bungie API and other online resources.

## SETUP:

First make sure you have a Discord bot API key which you can get from signing up on the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers) and creating an application. 

Once you have that, clone this repo and put your API key in the `TOKEN` variable in the [bot.py](https://github.com/jaykibi/Cayde-7/blob/main/bot.py) file's `run_discord_bot()` function:

    def run_discord_bot():
    TOKEN = ### INSERT API TOKEN HERE ###

Once you have done that, run the [main.py](https://github.com/jaykibi/Cayde-7/blob/main/main.py) file either in your terminal or an IDE (PyCharm is a good one)

And that should get you the basic functionality of Cayde-7. 

Enjoy! :)
